Title: Non-standard Evaluation and Partial Function Application with Promises

Description: Provides an approach to non-standard evaluation and partial function
    application (including automatic partial function application, as known as
    currying) based on R's built-in promises. Non-standard evaluation with promises
    allows both code and execution environment to be captured and forwarded to
    function calls in a manner broadly compatible with existing code that uses
    non-standard evaluation techniques already built in to the language.
